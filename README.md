# 🌦️ Weather Card – React + OpenWeather API

A simple yet polished weather application built with **React.js**.  
It fetches real-time weather data from the **OpenWeather API** and displays it in a neat, responsive weather card.  
I made this as part of my **ACM Club mini-project** while learning React.
